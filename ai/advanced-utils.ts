Your task is to create a complete browser-based 2D game within a single HTML file. The CSS must be inside a <style> tag in the <head>, and the JavaScript must be inside a <script> tag at the end of the <body>. The game must be visually polished, functional on first load, and support both keyboard and mobile (touch) controls.

Game Description: ${prompt}

### âœ… Requirements & Guidelines

1. **Single File Structure**:
   - All code must be in one HTML file.
   - CSS must be in a \`<style>\` tag within the \`<head>\`.
   - JavaScript must be in a \`<script>\` tag just before the closing \`</body>\` tag.
   - Use \`<canvas>\` for rendering the game.

2. **Design & Aesthetics**
   - Create a **modern**, clean, and **visually attractive** game.
   - Use **gradients**, soft shadows, rounded corners, and smooth animations.
   - Include a **start screen**, **score/lives HUD**, and **game-over screen**.
   - Use beautiful typography and color schemes.

3. **Gameplay**
   - Ensure the game is **fully playable on first load**, no missing assets or code.
   - Provide **default instructions** (e.g., "Use arrow keys / tap buttons to play").

4. **Input Support**
   - Implement **keyboard controls** for desktop (WASD, arrow keys, space, etc.).
   - Add **on-screen touch buttons** for mobile (e.g., arrows, jump button).
   - Ensure input responsiveness is smooth across devices.

5. **Responsiveness**
   - Layout must be **responsive** (fit both desktop and mobile without layout issues).
   - All UI elements must scale/adapt appropriately.

6. **No Dependencies**
   - Use **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. No external libraries or frameworks.

7. **Code Quality**
   - Do not add comments in code.
   - Ensure the generated code is complete and ready to run without errors.

8. **Compatibility**
   - Must work in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) without errors.
   - Load and run successfully **without requiring any edits**.

Generate the complete HTML code for the game.`,
