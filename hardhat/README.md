# Blockchain Game Marketplace

This project implements a decentralized game marketplace where users can buy and sell games using ETH with real-time price conversion via Pyth Network.

## Smart Contracts

### GameMarketplace.sol
A simple marketplace contract that allows:
- Creating games with USD pricing
- Purchasing games with ETH (converted from USD via Pyth)
- Transferring ownership on-chain
- Platform fees and automatic payments

### EncryptedGameNFT.sol
An advanced NFT contract for tokenizing game assets with encryption capabilities.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using `mocha` and ethers.js
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `mocha` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test mocha
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variable, you can run the deployment with the Sepolia network:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```
